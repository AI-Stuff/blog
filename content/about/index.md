Thank you for visiting my website! I recently graduated Worcester Polytechnic
Institute with a B.S. in Computer Science, and I currently work as a Machine
Learning Research Associate at [Harvard Medical
School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) in the [Image and Data
Analysis Core](https://idac.hms.harvard.edu/).

Previously, I have worked at [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html), and [Cabot Investment Technology](https://www.cabotintech.com/).

Thank you for visiting my website! I am currently a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, on track to graduate this December with a B.S. in Computer Science.

Previously, I have worked at [Analog Devices Inc.](https://www.analog.com/en/index.html), and [Cabot Investment Technology](https://www.cabotintech.com/).

I am currently studying Algorithmic Trading, and hope to pursue a career in the field.
